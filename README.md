Certainly, here's the text version of your project description:

Hello I am Anil, This is the project that my education in the field of NLP, which was given to me during the Becode Training process.

I have completed my work on the content-based recommendation system and we have achieved successful results on a movie dataset of 45K data. This system is an artificial intelligence model that can be used to provide personalized recommendations to users.

First of all, preprocessing steps such as cleaning the text data in the dataset of the movies and tokenization were carried out. Thanks to these steps, keywords were determined for the movies.

Then, the importance degrees of the keywords were calculated by TF-IDF method. In this way, similarity scores between films could be calculated by determining the keywords of each film.

Finally, for a movie the user watched, the system calculated similarity scores by comparing it with other movies, and the movies with the highest similarity scores were recommended assuming they had similar characteristics to the movie the user was watching.

All of these processes have an important role in the content-based recommendation system and can be used to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their interests.

## Analysis Part 

<p>
    I have prepared a dashboard using the latest Tableau that allows you to explore more information about a selected movie. The dashboard includes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>4 movie recommendations</li>
    <li>The language of the movie</li>
    <li>Average review score</li>
    <li>Genre of the movie</li>
    <li>Producer company of the film</li>
    <li>The time of release of the movie in the cinema</li>
    <li>Movie release date</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You can easily visualize this information at a glance on the dashboard. I hope you find this study useful. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. You can find my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles on the left or scan the QR code on the dashboard to navigate directly to my LinkedIn profile.

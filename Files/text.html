    <h1>Content-Based Movie Recommendation System</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, my education project in the field of NLP, which was given to me
      during the Becode Education process.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have completed my work on the content-based recommendation system and we
      have achieved successful results on a movie dataset of 45 thousand data.
      This system is an artificial intelligence model that can be used to
      provide personalized recommendations to users.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, preprocessing steps such as cleaning the text data in the
      data set of the movies and tokenization were carried out. Thanks to these
      steps, keywords were determined for the movies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the importance degrees of the keywords were calculated by TF-IDF
      method. In this way, similarity scores between films could be calculated
      by determining the keywords of each film.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, for a movie the user watched, the system calculated similarity
      scores by comparing it with other movies, and the movies with the highest
      similarity scores were recommended assuming they had similar
      characteristics to the movie the user was watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these processes have an important role in the content-based
      recommendation system and can be used to provide personalized
      recommendations to users based on their interests.
    </p>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <p>
      It gives you the recommendations of the films with the closest score
      between 1-5 with the Model I have installed.
    </p>

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>
      I have prepared a dashboard where you can get more information about the
      movie you selected by visualizing this data with the latest Tableau. On
      the Dashboard:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>4 Movie recommendations</li>
      <li>The Language of the Movie</li>
      <li>Average Review Score</li>
      <li>Genre of the movie</li>
      <li>Producer Company of the Film</li>
      <li>The Time of Release of the Movie in the Cinema</li>
      <li>Movie Release Date</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can learn about the information visually at a glance.</p>

    <p>
      We hope that this study will be useful for you. If you have any questions,
      please do not hesitate to contact us.
